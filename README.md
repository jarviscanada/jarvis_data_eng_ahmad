-   [Linux & SQL:](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ahmad/tree/develop/linux_sql) Developed a cluster management solution using _Bash_ to record hardware specifications and periodically monitor resource usages of individual nodes in a cluster of servers.Used _Docker_ instantiated RDBMS _PostgreSQL_ database for data persistence. Gathered and registered real time data in the database instance using _crontab_ jobs.
-   **[Java Grep](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ahmad/tree/develop/core_java/grep):** Implemented Unix grep command in Java using _Stream API_ and _Lambda Expressions_.
-   **[Java JDBC](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ahmad/tree/develop/core_java/jdbc):** Developed an application using _JDBC_ along with _PostgreSQL_ to provide abstraction using different design patterns.Used both _DAO(Data Access Object)_ and _Repository pattern_ to provide abstraction on database/data files incorporating complex joins and queries.
-   **[Twitter CLI App](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ahmad/tree/develop/twitter):** Used _MVC_ architecture to implement a twitter application which allows user to Post, Delete and show Tweets through command line.Performed unit testing using _Mockito_ framework and handled database interactions through *JDBC.*Managed dependencies of different layers within the application using _Spring Boot_ framework.

## Professional Experiences

**Data Engineer,Jarvis, Toronto(2020-Present):** Develop Linux and Java-based applications with _maven_ automation tool. These applications handling databases through JDBC **and interacting with **REST APIs such as of Twitter. Unit testing is performed using Mockito framework and auto-configuration of dependencies files is done using Spring Boot **framework.

**Data Scientist, LUMS, Lahore (2017-2018):** Performed exploratory data analysis using _Tableau_, data pre-processing using Python __and data base management using MySQL.Carried out telecom coverage analysis using Machine Learning Algorithms including SVR (Support Vector Regression), ANN (Artificial Neural Network) with Keras_,_ _Tensor Flow_ and Outlier Detection through cluster-based approaches including K*-*Means clustering and DBSCAN. Managed and guided a team of full and part-time researchers.
## Education & Academic Projects

**University of Waterloo (2018-2019)**, Master of Engineering, Computer Engineering
-   **Sale Price Prediction:** Designed an end to end Machine Learning _Pipeline_(_object-oriented_) to predict the price of item listings on online shopping platform.Developed front end **_REST API_** using **_flask_** framework, used Jenkins for designing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (**_CI/CD_**) pipeline and deployed the model on the **_AWS-EC2_** platform using **_Docker_** for containerization. The proposed architecture achieved a RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of 0.241
-   **Data Mining on Yelp Dataset:** Analyzed Yelp Data to find patterns and perform customer analytics. Set-up and stored data in MySQL server database. Wrote complex and nested queries to perform data cleaning and extract meaningful customer information. Performed **_CRUD_** Operations, imposed sanity and consistency conditions. Added indexes for efficient data querying and created ER .Implemented both the **_Decision Tree Classifier_** and **_Naive Bayes_** Predictor as stored procedures in **_MySQL_** through an interactive GUI in Python.
-   **Page Rank in PySpark:** Performed graph analysis using a graph of Gnutella server network.Implemented single source personalized page rank and handled dead end and spider trap problems using **_Spark_**.

- **Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting**:Built a prediction model using LSTM neural network to estimate future web traffic on distinct Wikipedia pages.Performed in depth exploratory data analysis (**_EDA_**) to detect trends and seasonality in the data using pandas, seaborn and matplotlib. Performed differencing to achieve stationarity and used Augmented Dicky fuller test to identify it.Developed a **LSTM** model with baseline **_ARIMA_** model, the MAPE score improved significantly from 8.2 to 7.27 percent.

**Lahore University of Management Science (2013-2017)**, Bachelor of Applied Science, Electrical Engineering

-  **Optimized installation of security cameras at traffic intersections:** Developed Python and C++ computer-based application for the local police to optimize the number of street traffic cameras by solving the vertex cover.Integrated python scripts with C++ using inter process communication via piping, multi threading and solved vertex cover problem using SAT solvers.
